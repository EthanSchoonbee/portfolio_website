## 👨‍💻 About The Project

Ever wondered what would happen if a developer's portfolio merged with their favorite code editor? Well, I did! This portfolio website is designed to look and feel like an IDE, because why not make browsing through my professional journey as familiar as writing code?

### 🎯 Key Features

- **IDE-Inspired Design**: Information is structured in TypeScript constant format
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Because we all have preferences, and our eyes deserve options
- **Interactive Sections**:
  - `about.ts`: Get to know the developer behind the code
  - `skills.ts`: Tech stack and capabilities
  - `experience.ts`: Professional journey
  - `education.ts`: Academic background
  - `projects.ts`: Showcase of work
  - `resume.ts`: Formal qualifications
- **Easter Egg**: There's a hidden surprise in the profile picture (Try to find it! 🕵️‍♂️)
